INSTRUCTIONS FOR STUDENTS

Make sure the programs following are installed:
Python (Version 3.8 or later)
Pip (run `pip --version` in the terminal to check if it's working)

Setup the discord bot:
Open a terminal (Powershell in Windows, Terminal in MacOS).
Copy the location of the discord bot folder. In Windows, it may look something like `C:\Users\username\Downloads\discord-bot-template`. On MacOS, the location may resemble `/Users/username/Downloads/discord-bot-template`.
Run `cd <location>`, substituting in the location you copied just now.
Run `pip install -e .` to install dependencies. Note that there is a fullstop "." after "-e".

Run the discord bot:
In your terminal, run `python discordbot/bot.py`
If python complains of files not existing, your terminal might be in a different folder. You can rectify this by running `cd <location>`. See "Setup the discord bot" for more info.
If python says "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named discordbot.secrets", it means that your token is currently not stored in a file called `secrets.py` in the `discordbot` folder. In this case, you should create `discordbot/secrets.py` with the token. `secrets.py` should like this, with the placeholder replaced with your token:

```
token = "<INSERT YOUR TOKEN HERE>"
```
